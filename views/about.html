    Collab Box is a simple collaborative textarea made in a few hours,
    as an excersize to learn better how to use node.js and socket.io. It turned out that the node
    and socket.io bits were probably the easiest parts of developing this. Correctly capturing
    different types of input in the text box (editing with the mouse is still unimplimented)
    and updating it for everyone else without sending the entire contents every time, then also
    ensuring that different people are able to type in different places at once, turned out to be
    relatively more tricky than setting up the node and socket.io servers themselves.
